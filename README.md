# PowerHouse_TaskManager 2.1
This is the user base repository for enthusiasts ready to test their machines and know more about their hardware.
This windows task manager shows the CPU, RAM, disk usage powered by .Net C# and Bunifu Ui
A few kernal classes was called to pull required data, a couple of charts and progress bars

## Fixes & Bugs
- set process refresh to 30 seconds.
- the app throws an exception when there is an influx on the read counter (fixed by ignoring influx)
- some reading might be too large to understand

## Updates
- added image icons on most tabs
- added a read process counter
- the app will remeber the selected process on refresh
- added a virtual memory reading on the ram tab
- The app is now not sizeable
- added GPU readings (stilling tweaking)
